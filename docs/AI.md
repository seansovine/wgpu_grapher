# Thoughts on AI as a Tool

So far my use of AI has been limited to reading the summaries and code snippets provided at the
top of the Google search results. I have to say those _have_ saved me a lot of time and
effort in digging through documentation recently, and maybe a few times they pointed out a way
of doing things I wasn't previously aware of and _maybe_ wouldn't have found by other means.
But often the approach the AI suggested was one I ultimately didn't go with, because it didn't
seem best given the nuances of what I was working on. And sometimes it was just wrong.

I plan to keep using this tool _cautiously_, but I am committed to
_understanding_ what's behind the things it suggests. Because in my opinion, understanding
how things work is what lets us make nice and useful things. And I think there _is_ something
important to be gained from manually reading through the documentation for the things you use. I view
AI as a search tool to help find examples and specific parts of the available information that
can be useful. So I think in the best case AI can be a tool to help us achieve a greater
understanding of things. But I know that understanding will _always_ take effort. I think there
are useful tools, but no shortcuts around hard work and thinking.
